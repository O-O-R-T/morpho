🧬 About Morpho
Morpho is building the future of decentralized AI onchain. We’re not just another cloud platform — we’re a fully decentralized AI stack, powered by blockchain verification and global infrastructure from data centers to edge devices.

With services from data collection and labeling to decentralized storage and model training, Morpho flips the script on traditional AI development. Transparent. Trustless. Permissionless. AI, the crypto way.

🚀 Why Morpho?
At Morpho, we’re on a mission to democratize AI — making it accessible, transparent, and owned by the community. We’re trusted by over 10,000 users, including heavyweights like DELL, Lenovo Image, and BNB Smart Chain.

Morpho is where Web3 meets AI — and the outcome is a trustless, decentralized engine for machine intelligence.

🛠️ Morpho Product Suite
🔹 Morpho DataHub
Crowdsourced AI data, verified onchain.
Global users label and contribute training data — all recorded immutably via blockchain. No middlemen, no black boxes.

🔹 Morpho Storage
Decentralized object storage that rivals AWS — at 60% less cost.
Powered by Seagate, Tencent Cloud, and Deimos edge devices.

🔹 Morpho Compute 
Distributed GPU infrastructure for training and inference — geo-distributed, cost-optimized, fully decentralized.

🔹 Olympus Protocol
Morpho’s proprietary blockchain layer, running a novel Proof of Honesty (PoH) consensus. Olympus syncs all DePIN devices and ensures transparent, verifiable compute across the network.

📈 Morpho in the Real World
🔸 Dell launched its Japan loyalty program with Morpho's tech stack.
🔸 Lenovo Image (now ZX) integrated Morpho TDS to power decentralized AI in customer service.
🔸 Morpho + BNB Greenfield: we’re helping secure the BNB Chain’s decentralized storage layer.

🌍 Morpho x DePIN
Morpho is a cornerstone of the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) movement — enabling real-world data, storage, and compute to plug into crypto-native systems.

Whether you’re training models, storing sensitive data, or building onchain apps that rely on AI — Morpho’s decentralized stack has you covered.
